  <p>Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, 
    often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the 
    contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These 
    included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used
    to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code
    and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse
    of code.</p>
